Hi, I am Yi-Ling Chung. [CV](https://github.com/yilingchung/yilingchung.github.io/blob/master/files/CV_YiLingChung.pdf)

I am a third-year PhD student in [Information and Communication Technologies](https://ict.unitn.it/) at the University of Trento. I am also affiliated with the [NLP Research Unit](https://ict.fbk.eu/units/nlp/) at Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK) under the supervision of [Marco Guerini](http://www.marcoguerini.eu/). My research focuses on knowledge-grounded counter-narrative generation in a multilingual scenario, employing external knowledge resources and transfer learning.
