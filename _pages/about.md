HiðŸ‘‹, I am Yi-Ling.

I am a final year PhD student in [Information and Communication Technologies](https://ict.unitn.it/) at the University of Trento. I am also affiliated with the [NLP Research Unit](https://ict.fbk.eu/units/nlp/) at Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK) under the supervision of [Marco Guerini](http://www.marcoguerini.eu/). My research focuses on hate speech mitigation via data curation and knowledge-grounded counter narrative generation in a multilingual scenario, employing external knowledge resources and transfer learning. In January 2022, I join [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) as a research associate working on online safety and counter speech!
